    <h1>Story Time</h1>
    <p>2 years ago, When i started my Brand i went to a modelling agency to do a photo look book for the new collection</p>
    <p>Standing there, The manager looked at me and said "can you walk across the hall and walk right back let me see?"</p>
    <p>I said "sure why not", but in my head while i was walking i thought he was tripping or on some cheap drugs or something</p>
    <p> While i walking back he stared at me and he said "Emmanuel why don't you do the Antwerp Fashion Weekend for me next weekend for free </p>
    <p>and i will do your look book for free awsell you won't have to pay a dime" .Have in mind that the Photo book costed about 250 euro at the time</p>
    <p> So i agreed without hesistating even though i had the money. 1 years after no Look Book, no follow up emails, no call or replies</p>
    <p> 2 years later,then i became seriously in need of the look book, so i called and sent an email mentioning that i will pay for the look book if he won't do it for free as we agreed</p>
    <p>2 days later, i got the reply and was booked for the photo shoot, so i paid the photographer 250 Euros for it, meaning i worked for free at the Antwerp Fashion Weekend 2019</p>

  <p>Sometimes, We can't see what distracts us from our purpose untill its too late, because how could we know </p>
