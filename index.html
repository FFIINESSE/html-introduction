    <h1>Story Time;</h1>
    <p>2 years ago, when i started my brand i went to a modelling agency to do a photo look book for the new collection</p>
    <p>Standing there, The manager looked at me and said "can you walk across the hall and walk right back let me see?"</p>
    <p>I said "sure why not", but in my head while i was walking i thought he was tripping or on some cheap drugs or something</p>
    <p> While i walking back he stared at me and he said "Emmanuel why don't you do the Antwerp Fashion Weekend for me next weekend for free </p>
    <p>and i will do your photo book for free you won't have to pay a dime", .Have in mind that the Photo book costed about 250 euro at the time</p>
    <p> So i agreed without hesistating even though i had the money to pay then. 1 years after no photo book, no follow up emails and no call replies</p>
    <p> 2 years later,then i became seriously in need of the photo look book, so i insisted called and sent emails requesting to pay for it</p>
    <p>2 days later, i got the reply and booked for the photo shoot and paid 250 Euros for it, meaning i worked for free at the Antwerp Fashion Weekend</p>
